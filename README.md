* The variables/coefficients which provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset were "vehicle length" and "ground clearance."
* The slope of the linear model would not be considered to be zero since the p-value is 5.3E-11, which is less than 0.05, indicating that the results of the analysis are     significant, and that one can reject the null hypothesis. 
* The linear model does predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively since the r-squared value is equivalent to  0.7149. Therefore, 71.5% of the variability of our   dependent variable, mpg, is explained using this linear model.           

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

* The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?
* There is a summary that addresses the design specification requirement for all the manufacturing lots and each lot individually (5 pt)

## T-Tests on Suspension Coils
T-test for all Lots:

* There is a summary of the t-test results across all manufacturing lots and for each lot (5 pt)

## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition
* Write a short description of a statistical study that can quantify how the MechaCar performs against the competition. In your study design, think critically about what metrics would be of interest to a consumer: for a few examples, cost, city or highway fuel efficiency, horse power, maintenance cost, or safety rating.
* In your description, address the following questions:
* What metric or metrics are you going to test?
* What is the null hypothesis or alternative hypothesis?
* What statistical test would you use to test the hypothesis? And why?
* What data is needed to run the statistical test?
